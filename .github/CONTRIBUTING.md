## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

### New Feature or Enhancement

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please [search][search-label-feature-enhancement] for existing feature or enhancement in [Issues][search-label-feature-enhancement].

### Code Contributions

If you would like to implement new feature, enhancement or fix a bug, please consider size of your change.

* __Major changes__ which you want to contribute should be discussed first in Issues so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Please ensure that your issue was labeled with [`status:ready for adoption`][search-label-status-ready-for-adoption] before you start working on it.
* __Small change__ can be submitted as a Pull Request following [PR Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* When only changing documentation or fixing some typos, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description
